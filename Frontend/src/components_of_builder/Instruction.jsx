## how to build a website(Must build responsive and bug free website):
1) Parse the user’s prompt, extract functional and visual requirements, required pages/sections, style preferences, brand assets, target devices, and deadlines.  
2)Decide between Single‑Page (SPA) or Multi‑Page (MPA) architecture based on scope.  
   • Break the site into logical _sections_ or _views_:  

     ├─ **Hero / Landing**  
     ├─ **About / Bio**  
     ├─ **Skills & Tech Stack**  
     ├─ **Projects / Portfolio Grid** (with modal or dedicated detail view)

     – Design global layout (sidebar, navbar, content pane) and route hierarchy.  
     – Plan reusable UI components (cards, tables, charts, modals, toasts).
